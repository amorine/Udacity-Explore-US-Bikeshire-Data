### Explore US Bikeshare Data
The **"Explore US Bikeshare Data"** project is Project 2 of the Udacity Programming for Data Science course.

### Description
This project uses the Python programming language to explore bike share data for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

The datasets provided for these cities are in csv format ranging from 35-37MB in size. The data was randomly selected from the first six months of 2017. They had six (6) columns in common:

1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The project required providing descriptive statistics such as:

**#1 Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

**#2 Popular stations and trip**
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**#3 Trip duration**
* total travel time
* average travel time

**#4 User info**
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
To assist with answering these questions in Python, a script template was provided along with the following datasets:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
